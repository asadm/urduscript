# UrduScript

![](docs/head.png?raw=true)

UrduScript is an [Urdish](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Urdish) dialect of JavaScript. The goal is to make programming more accessible to beginners from South Asia. UrduScript uses informal Urdu analogies to programming concepts, making it easy to get started without remembering keywords.

UrduScript transpiles to JavaScript. All JavaScript frameworks (like jQuery, UnderScore, React, etc) can be seemlessly used.

### Hello World
